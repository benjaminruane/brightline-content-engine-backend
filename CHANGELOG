## [v3.0.0] – Clean backend with CORS + scoring

**Date:** 2025-11-23 (adjust as needed)

### Added
- Model-based scoring via `helpers/scoring.js`, returning:
  - overall score (0–100)
  - clarity, accuracy, tone, structure (0–1)
- Scenario-aware prompts and length guidance in `/api/generate` and `/api/rewrite`.

### Changed
- Rebuilt `/api/generate` and `/api/rewrite` with:
  - safer OpenAI client usage
  - consistent response shape (`outputs` array + metrics)
  - currency normalisation and soft word limit helper functions.
- Unified CORS handling across all endpoints to support:
  - frontend on `content-engine-frontend-gilt.vercel.app`
  - local testing and future environments.

### Fixed
- Vercel deployment failures due to `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ']'`.
- CORS preflight failures on `/api/generate` when called from the frontend.

## [v2.0.0] – Stable backend

**Date:** last week (adjust if you want a specific date)

### Added
- Initial `/api/generate` and `/api/rewrite` endpoints.
- Basic style guide and prompt templates.
- Early version of scoring (stubbed / simplified).
- Health endpoint `/api/health`.

### Notes
- This was the first “stable” backend used in early UI iterations.
- Superseded by v3.0.0 after CORS + syntax fixes and scoring improvements.

---

## [v1.0.0] – Initial prototype

### Added
- First working proof-of-concept for AI-assisted investment writing.
- Simple React frontend, single output type, minimal error handling.
