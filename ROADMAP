# 🚀 **CONTENT ENGINE – MASTER ROADMAP**

A unified roadmap covering UI/UX, core generation workflows, grounding, scoring, Ask AI, reliability, and future architectural enhancements.

---

# **PHASE 1 — FOUNDATIONS & STABILITY (Completed / Ongoing Polishing)**

Core stabilisation of the new frontend and backend.

### ✅ 1.1 Port & stabilise major modules

* Modularised UI: Versions Panel, Ask AI Panel, Rewrite Panel, Draft Output, Sources Panel
* Core hooks: `useDraftState` rewrite
* Improved state management, removal of legacy bugs
* Clean separation between Generate / Rewrite / Ask AI flows

### ✅ 1.2 Generating clean drafts

* Stable API integration (`/api/generate`)
* Draft text updates + version creation
* Score fallback when backend scoring unavailable
* Auto-scroll to top after generate

### ✅ 1.3 Rewrite flow upgrade

* Create new version on rewrite
* Auto-reset analysis
* Auto-scroll
* Muting/unmuting inputs correctly
* Rewrite polish (loading state, dim, fade-in animation)

### 🔧 1.4 UI polish pass (in progress)

* Loading dimming + pointer-block across all panels
* Fade-in animations for Versions, Ask AI, Rewrite
* Consistent cursor-wait states
* More premium interactions across the app
* Stable version card behaviour
* Fixing template literal instability in classNames
* Basic top bar & spacing improvements

---

# **PHASE 2 — ANALYSIS & RELIABILITY SYSTEMS (Completed / Ongoing Enhancements)**

### ✅ 2.1 Automatic Statement Analysis

* Auto-run after generate and rewrite
* Reliability scoring
* Explanation categorisation
* Color coding thresholds:

  * Green ≥ 90
  * Yellow ≥ 75
  * Red < 75

### 🔧 2.2 Improved scoring (completed)

* Replace client-side fallbacks when backend scoring exists
* More consistent version scoring
* Normalised scores across generate & rewrite flows

### 🔧 2.3 Enhancements (future small tasks)

* More descriptive implications (“speculative because…” etc.)
* Analysis toggle behaviour improvements
* Optional manual rerun with clearer UI

---

# **PHASE 3 — UI/UX NORMALISATION & PANEL RESTRUCTURE (Upcoming)**

### 🎯 3.1 Panel Layout Redesign

Goal: Make the interface elegant, compress vertical bloat, improve scanning.

Planned approach (your selected option):

* Collapsed/expandable sections
* First 5 lines preview for long sections
* Statement analysis visible by default
* Reduce vertical stacking in right panel

### 🎯 3.2 Top Bar improvements

* Premium look & feel
* Include version number
* Remove "Brightline" branding (use “Content Engine” consistently)

### 🎯 3.3 Input behaviour

* Grey-out Ask AI input after submission
* Enter-key behaviour across panels
* More graceful empty states

---

# **PHASE 4 — END-TO-END GENERATION WORKFLOW MATURITY (Upcoming)**

### 🎯 4.1 Advanced Settings Refinement

* Temperature + max tokens inside collapsible advanced settings
* Cleaner model selector
* Public Search toggle grouped logically

### 🎯 4.2 Source management improvements

* Proper “nice URL” display in the Sources table
* Scrollable source list
* Better handling of large pasted sources
* Improved URL fetch messaging

### 🎯 4.3 Versioning Enhancements

* Version comparison mode (future)
* Better timestamp formatting
* Metadata hover tooltips

---

# **PHASE 5 — ASK AI EVOLUTION (Future Enhancements)**

*(You specifically asked to defer these, so they live here.)*

### ⭐ 5.1 Improved Grounding Quality

Structure grounding information (draft, sources, metadata) in clearer formats to improve reliability.

### ⭐ 5.2 Structured Citations from Web Search

Return URLs + snippets used by the model for transparency.

### ⭐ 5.3 Intelligent Blending of Draft + Sources + Web

Introduce explicit prioritisation rules:

* Draft first
* Sources second
* Web last
  This prevents contradictions.

### ⭐ 5.4 Fallback Answer Logic

When web search fails, provide a clean fallback + disclosure.

### ⭐ 5.5 Debug Mode for Web Search

Developer-only view of:

* Search queries
* Returned URLs
* Extracted snippets
* Model decision steps (when possible)

---

# **PHASE 6 — ARCHITECTURAL & CORE ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS (Future / Optional)**

### 🔮 6.1 Multi-model orchestration

Use large models for reasoning, cheap models for summarising.

### 🔮 6.2 Caching & document embedding prep

Ability to store source embeddings for long-term projects.

### 🔮 6.3 Style Guide Engine (later major release)

Persistent investment-writing style rules (Partners Group-quality):

* Tone constraints
* Macro wording rules
* Forbidden phrases
* Preferred language patterns

### 🔮 6.4 Export formats

* Word
* PDF
* Markdown with citations

---

# **PHASE 7 — ENTERPRISE READINESS (Long-term Vision)**

### 🏢 7.1 Single Workspace → Multi-Workspace support

Multi-client mode.

### 🏢 7.2 Document traceability & audit logs

* Each version logged with metadata
* Full source-trace summaries

### 🏢 7.3 Full data privacy & “on-prem” pathways

Enterprise-grade compliance.
